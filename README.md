# A full-stack lending tracker application

To start the server, run these commands after the first clone:
- `npm i`
- `npm start` (run this for further starting of the server, step i not required)

To connect to the server running in the localhost, get your PC's local IP address and then replace it [here](https://github.com/bhargawananbhuyan/rn_lendtrack_app/blob/master/app/src/utils/constants.ts). Don't change the PORT (:5000).
